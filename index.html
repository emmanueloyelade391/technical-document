          <p>This section is an introduction to HTML and CSS as a programming labguage.</p>
          <p>HTML is a progamming language that is used to develop functional 
             websites and customize webpages as users deem fit.
          </p>

             allows users to decorate their websites. They can change colors, modify the sizes 
             of elements, and etc.

          <header id="html-elements">HTML Elements</header>
          <p>Elements are the pieces of code that give life to webpages.</p>
          <p>Elements are the visible parts of code that you see on a web site. They are the called the "life" of a webpage bceause they give a webpage all of its functions.</p>
          <p>There are a variety of elements that one can use to manufacture their website. These are some common elements:
          <ul>
            <li>Image element: <code>img src= "link of picture"</code></li>
            <li>DIV element: <code>div class="name of class"</code></li>
            <li>Anchor element:<code>a href="hyperlink of other website/webpage"</code></li>
            <li>Heading element:<code>h1 "name of heading"</code></li>
            <li>Doctype element:<code>DOCTYPE "type of file the webpage is"</code></li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="example">
          <header id="example">Example</header>
          <p>Before you add the main content of your webpage, you need to lay the foundation of your webpage by setting it's language, it's size, characters, and linking it to CSS. You do that by writing: <ul>
            <li><code class="html-code">!DOCTYPE</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">html lang="en"</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">head</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">meta charset="utf-8"</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">head</code></li>
            <li><code class="html-code">html</code></li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="CSS">
          <header id="css">CSS</header>
        <p>Now that you have written the foundation of your webpage, you can customize your text by appyling CSS. When you used the link element you should have saw a box next to index.html that says style.css. Click that box and write:</p> <ul>
          <li><code class="css-code">.p {</code></li>
            <li><code class="css-code">font-style: arial;</code></li>
            <li><code class="css-code">font-color: grey;</code></li>
          <li><code class="css-code last-code">}</code></li>
          </code>
          </ul>
        <p>This code will change the font of your text.</p>
